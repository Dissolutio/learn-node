# My first Node App!

I built this app while completing the course [Learn Node](https://learnnode.com/) made by Wes Bos.
I am hosting my project using [Now by Zeit](https://zeit.co/now). So all you need to do is:

1. Go to [https://austin-eats-lcwhfvkbhx.now.sh/](https://austin-eats-lcwhfvkbhx.now.sh//)

    ![visit store](/app-screenshots/screen0.PNG)

2. View Individual Store Pages

    ![visit store](/app-screenshots/store.PNG)

3. Browse by store tags

    ![visit store](/app-screenshots/tags.PNG)

4. Browse with a Google Map

    ![visit store](/app-screenshots/map.PNG)

5. Check out those autocomplete and pagination features!
